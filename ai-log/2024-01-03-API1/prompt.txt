help me implement the following endpoint
user, title_id and rating value must be given in request body
ChatGPT
To implement an endpoint that allows users to upload ratings for movies or shows, you will need to create a POST route that accepts user identifiers, title identifiers, and rating values. Here's how you can set up the /uploadrating endpoint:

Step 1: Define the Route Handler
First, create a function in your controller file (e.g., controllers/ratingController.js):

javascript
Copy code
async function uploadRating(req, res) {
    const { userId, titleId, ratingValue } = req.body;

    try {
        // Validate the input
        if (!userId || !titleId || ratingValue === undefined) {
            return res.status(400).json({ message: 'Missing user ID, title ID, or rating value' });
        }

        // Query to check if a rating already exists
        const checkRatingQuery = `
            SELECT * FROM ratings WHERE user_id = ? AND title_id = ?;
        `;

        // Query to insert or update the rating
        let ratingQuery = '';
        const [existingRating] = await pool.query(checkRatingQuery, [userId, titleId]);

        if (existingRating.length > 0) {
            // Rating exists, update it
            ratingQuery = `
                UPDATE ratings
                SET rating_value = ?
                WHERE user_id = ? AND title_id = ?;
            `;
        } else {
            // Rating does not exist, insert it
            ratingQuery = `
                INSERT INTO ratings (user_id, title_id, rating_value)
                VALUES (?, ?, ?);
            `;
        }

        // Execute the insert or update query
        await pool.query(ratingQuery, [ratingValue, userId, titleId]);

        res.status(200).json({ message: 'Rating uploaded successfully' });
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(error);
        res.status(500).json({ message: 'Server error', error: error.message });
    }
}

module.exports = uploadRating;
Step 2: Define the Endpoint in Your Routes
Create or update the routes file (e.g., routes/ratingRoutes.js):

javascript
Copy code
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();
const ratingController = require('../controllers/ratingController');

router.post('/uploadrating', ratingController.uploadRating);

module.exports = router;
Step 3: Use the Router in Your Application
In your app.js or equivalent server file:

javascript
Copy code
const ratingRoutes = require('./routes/ratingRoutes');
// other imports and middleware...

app.use('/api', ratingRoutes);

// continue with the rest of your app setup...
Now, you can test the endpoint by making a POST request to /api/uploadrating with a JSON body containing userId, titleId, and ratingValue.

Note:
Ensure that you have a ratings table with user_id, title_id, and rating_value columns.
You may need to handle data types and constraints according to your database schema, such as converting the rating value to the appropriate type if it's not already a number.
Always validate the input data to protect against SQL injection and other forms of invalid data. Parameterized queries, as used in the example, help prevent SQL injection.
Depending on your authentication setup, you may need to verify that the userId matches the currently authenticated user to prevent users from uploading ratings on behalf of others.

ChatGPT
Given the structure of your titles and user_title_ratings tables, you can write a function to handle POST requests for uploading user ratings. This function will insert or update a rating in the user_title_ratings table and potentially update the average_rating and num_votes in the titles table if you want to recalculate these values each time a new rating is submitted.

Here's how you might implement the uploadRating function:

javascript
Copy code
async function uploadRating(req, res) {
    const { userId, titleId, userRating } = req.body;

    try {
        // Validate the input
        if (!userId || !titleId || userRating === undefined) {
            return res.status(400).json({ message: 'Missing required fields' });
        }

        // Check if the rating already exists
        const existingRatingQuery = `
            SELECT user_rating FROM user_title_ratings 
            WHERE user_id = ? AND title_id = ?;
        `;
        const [existingRating] = await pool.query(existingRatingQuery, [userId, titleId]);

        if (existingRating.length > 0) {
            // Rating exists, update it
            const updateRatingQuery = `
                UPDATE user_title_ratings
                SET user_rating = ?
                WHERE user_id = ? AND title_id = ?;
            `;
            await pool.query(updateRatingQuery, [userRating, userId, titleId]);
        } else {
            // Rating does not exist, insert new rating
            const insertRatingQuery = `
                INSERT INTO user_title_ratings (user_id, title_id, user_rating)
                VALUES (?, ?, ?);
            `;
            await pool.query(insertRatingQuery, [userId, titleId, userRating]);
        }

        // Optionally, recalculate the average rating and num_votes for the title
        // This is a simplified version and might not be optimal for production use
        const recalculateRatingsQuery = `
            UPDATE titles 
            SET 
                average_rating = (
                    SELECT AVG(user_rating) 
                    FROM user_title_ratings 
                    WHERE title_id = ?
                ), 
                num_votes = (
                    SELECT COUNT(*) 
                    FROM user_title_ratings 
                    WHERE title_id = ?
                )
            WHERE title_id = ?;
        `;
        await pool.query(recalculateRatingsQuery, [titleId, titleId, titleId]);

        res.status(200).json({ message: 'Rating uploaded successfully' });
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(error);
        res.status(500).json({ message: 'Server error', error: error.message });
    }
}

module.exports = uploadRating;
In this function:

We first check if a rating by the user for the title already exists.
If it does, we update the existing rating.
If it doesn't, we insert a new rating.
After inserting or updating the rating, we recalculate the average rating and the total number of votes for the title. This recalculation is optional and can be handled differently depending on your application's requirements. For instance, you might want to do this periodically in a batch rather than updating it every time a new rating is submitted.
It's important to note that recalculating the average rating and vote count on every rating submission can be resource-intensive for applications with a high volume of ratings. Consider using a more efficient strategy for maintaining these statistics, such as scheduled jobs or triggers within the database.
Please ensure you have the necessary security checks in place, such as verifying the user's identity and ensuring they are authorized to rate the title. Also, consider using transactions if you need to ensure that both the rating update and the recalculation of averages happen atomically.




User
recalculate ratings too

ChatGPT
To recalculate the average rating and total vote count each time a new rating is submitted, you should use transactions to ensure that your database operations are performed atomically. This means either all operations will succeed, or none will, in case of an error.

Here's how you might modify the uploadRating function to include the recalculation:

javascript
Copy code
async function uploadRating(req, res) {
    const { userId, titleId, userRating } = req.body;

    // Start a database transaction
    const connection = await pool.getConnection();
    await connection.beginTransaction();

    try {
        // Check if the rating already exists
        const existingRatingQuery = `
            SELECT user_rating FROM user_title_ratings 
            WHERE user_id = ? AND title_id = ?;
        `;
        const [existingRating] = await connection.query(existingRatingQuery, [userId, titleId]);

        if (existingRating.length > 0) {
            // Rating exists, update it
            const updateRatingQuery = `
                UPDATE user_title_ratings
                SET user_rating = ?
                WHERE user_id = ? AND title_id = ?;
            `;
            await connection.query(updateRatingQuery, [userRating, userId, titleId]);
        } else {
            // Rating does not exist, insert new rating
            const insertRatingQuery = `
                INSERT INTO user_title_ratings (user_id, title_id, user_rating)
                VALUES (?, ?, ?);
            `;
            await connection.query(insertRatingQuery, [userId, titleId, userRating]);
        }

        // Recalculate the average rating and num_votes for the title
        const recalculateRatingsQuery = `
            UPDATE titles 
            SET 
                average_rating = (
                    SELECT AVG(user_rating) 
                    FROM user_title_ratings 
                    WHERE title_id = ?
                ), 
                num_votes = (
                    SELECT COUNT(*) 
                    FROM user_title_ratings 
                    WHERE title_id = ?
                )
            WHERE title_id = ?;
        `;
        await connection.query(recalculateRatingsQuery, [titleId, titleId, titleId]);

        // If everything was successful, commit the transaction
        await connection.commit();
        connection.release();

        res.status(200).json({ message: 'Rating uploaded successfully' });
    } catch (error) {
        // If any error occurs, roll back the transaction and log the error
        await connection.rollback();
        connection.release();
        console.error(error);
        res.status(500).json({ message: 'Server error', error: error.message });
    }
}

module.exports = uploadRating;
In this updated function:

We obtain a connection from the pool and start a transaction.
We perform our queries using this transactional connection.
If all queries are successful, we commit the transaction.
If an error occurs during any of the queries, we roll back the entire transaction to maintain data integrity.
After handling the transaction, we release the connection back to the pool.
This approach ensures that the new rating and the recalculated averages are either both saved or both discarded, preserving the consistency of your data. It is particularly important in environments where multiple concurrent transactions are occurring.




User
use the current num votes and average rating

ChatGPT
To use the current number of votes and average rating for recalculating the new values after a user submits a rating, we can apply the following formula for the new average:

scss
Copy code
new_average = (current_average * current_num_votes + new_user_rating) / (current_num_votes + 1)
The new number of votes is simply the current number of votes plus one.

Here's how you might implement this in the uploadRating function:

javascript
Copy code
async function uploadRating(req, res) {
    const { userId, titleId, userRating } = req.body;

    // Start a database transaction
    const connection = await pool.getConnection();
    await connection.beginTransaction();

    try {
        // Check if the rating already exists
        const existingRatingQuery = `
            SELECT user_rating FROM user_title_ratings 
            WHERE user_id = ? AND title_id = ?;
        `;
        const [existingRating] = await connection.query(existingRatingQuery, [userId, titleId]);

        // Retrieve the current average rating and number of votes
        const currentRatingQuery = `
            SELECT average_rating, num_votes FROM titles WHERE title_id = ?;
        `;
        const [currentRatingData] = await connection.query(currentRatingQuery, [titleId]);
        const currentAverage = currentRatingData[0].average_rating || 0;
        const currentNumVotes = currentRatingData[0].num_votes || 0;

        if (existingRating.length > 0) {
            // Rating exists, update it
            const updateRatingQuery = `
                UPDATE user_title_ratings
                SET user_rating = ?
                WHERE user_id = ? AND title_id = ?;
            `;
            await connection.query(updateRatingQuery, [userRating, userId, titleId]);
        } else {
            // Rating does not exist, insert new rating
            const insertRatingQuery = `
                INSERT INTO user_title_ratings (user_id, title_id, user_rating)
                VALUES (?, ?, ?);
            `;
            await connection.query(insertRatingQuery, [userId, titleId, userRating]);
        }

        // Calculate the new average rating
        const newAverage = ((currentAverage * currentNumVotes) + userRating) / (currentNumVotes + 1);
        const newNumVotes = currentNumVotes + 1;

        // Update the titles table with the new average and new number of votes
        const updateTitleRatingQuery = `
            UPDATE titles
            SET 
                average_rating = ?,
                num_votes = ?
            WHERE title_id = ?;
        `;
        await connection.query(updateTitleRatingQuery, [newAverage, newNumVotes, titleId]);

        // Commit the transaction
        await connection.commit();
        connection.release();

        res.status(200).json({ message: 'Rating uploaded successfully' });
    } catch (error) {
        // Roll back the transaction in case of an error
        await connection.rollback();
        connection.release();
        console.error(error);
        res.status(500).json({ message: 'Server error', error: error.message });
    }
}

module.exports = uploadRating;
In this updated function:

Before updating or inserting the new rating, we retrieve the current average and total number of votes for the title.
If there is an existing rating from the user, we simply update the rating without changing the total number of votes.
If it's a new rating, we calculate the new average rating based on the existing average and number of votes, then insert the new rating and update the total votes accordingly.
The updated average and vote count are saved to the titles table, and the transaction is committed.
Please note that this example assumes average_rating is already in the appropriate numeric format and userRating is passed in as a number. Adjust the types and logic as necessary to fit your database schema.

can I use the current file?
utils/database.js
const mysql = require('mysql2/promise');

/* create connection and export it */
const pool = mysql.createPool({
    host: process.env.DB_HOST,
    port: process.env.DB_PORT,
    user: process.env.DB_USER,
    password: process.env.DB_PASS,
    database: process.env.DB,
});

module.exports = { pool };

ChatGPT
Yes, you can use the current utils/database.js file that you've provided. It correctly sets up a connection pool using the mysql2/promise library, which is suitable for handling transactions. Your uploadRating function can import this pool and use it to execute database operations.

Here is a revised version of the uploadRating function that uses the connection pool from your utils/database.js file:

javascript
Copy code
const { pool } = require('../utils/database'); // Import the pool

async function uploadRating(req, res) {
    const { userId, titleId, userRating } = req.body;

    try {
        // Start a database transaction
        const connection = await pool.getConnection();
        await connection.beginTransaction();

        // Check if the rating already exists
        const existingRatingQuery = `
            SELECT user_rating FROM user_title_ratings 
            WHERE user_id = ? AND title_id = ?;
        `;
        const [existingRating] = await connection.query(existingRatingQuery, [userId, titleId]);

        // Retrieve the current average rating and number of votes
        const currentRatingQuery = `
            SELECT average_rating, num_votes FROM titles WHERE title_id = ?;
        `;
        const [currentRatingData] = await connection.query(currentRatingQuery, [titleId]);
        const currentAverage = currentRatingData[0]?.average_rating || 0;
        const currentNumVotes = currentRatingData[0]?.num_votes || 0;

        // Update or insert the new rating
        if (existingRating.length > 0) {
            // Rating exists, update it
            const updateRatingQuery = `
                UPDATE user_title_ratings
                SET user_rating = ?
                WHERE user_id = ? AND title_id = ?;
            `;
            await connection.query(updateRatingQuery, [userRating, userId, titleId]);
        } else {
            // Rating does not exist, insert new rating
            const insertRatingQuery = `
                INSERT INTO user_title_ratings (user_id, title_id, user_rating)
                VALUES (?, ?, ?);
            `;
            await connection.query(insertRatingQuery, [userId, title_id, userRating]);
        }

        // Calculate the new average rating and number of votes
        const newAverage = ((currentAverage * currentNumVotes) + userRating) / (currentNumVotes + 1);
        const newNumVotes = currentNumVotes + 1;

        // Update the titles table with the new average and new number of votes
        const updateTitleRatingQuery = `
            UPDATE titles
            SET average_rating = ?, num_votes = ?
            WHERE title_id = ?;
        `;
        await connection.query(updateTitleRatingQuery, [newAverage.toFixed(2), newNumVotes, titleId]);

        // Commit the transaction
        await connection.commit();
        connection.release(); // Release the connection back to the pool

        res.status(200).json({ message: 'Rating uploaded successfully' });
    } catch (error) {
        // If an error occurs, roll back the transaction
        await connection.rollback();
        connection.release();
        console.error(error);
        res.status(500).json({ message: 'Server error', error: error.message });
    }
}

module.exports = uploadRating;
Make sure to handle any necessary rounding or type conversion for the average_rating as it's stored as a DECIMAL(3,2) in your database. The toFixed(2) method in JavaScript is used here to format the new average to two decimal places before it is updated in the database.




User
explain what goes on with the connections

ChatGPT
In the provided uploadRating function, we are interacting with the MySQL database using a pool of connections. Here's a breakdown of what happens with the connections:

Importing the Connection Pool
javascript
Copy code
const { pool } = require('../utils/database'); // Import the pool
We import the pool from utils/database.js, which is an instance of a connection pool created by mysql2/promise. This pool manages multiple connections to your database, allowing for efficient reuse and management of those connections.
Getting a Connection from the Pool
javascript
Copy code
const connection = await pool.getConnection();
A connection is acquired from the pool. If all connections in the pool are in use, this call will wait until one becomes available. Once a connection is acquired, it's reserved for use in this particular request.
Starting a Transaction
javascript
Copy code
await connection.beginTransaction();
A transaction is started on the acquired connection. This ensures that the operations performed are part of a single transaction, which is important for maintaining data consistency. If an error occurs, all changes made during this transaction can be rolled back, leaving the database in its previous state.
Performing Database Operations
Database queries are executed using the connection.query method. These queries can insert data, update data, or select data based on the logic required. In this case, we check for an existing rating, insert or update the rating, and then recalculate the average rating.
Committing the Transaction
javascript
Copy code
await connection.commit();
If all database operations are successful, the transaction is committed. This makes all the changes permanent in the database.
Releasing the Connection
javascript
Copy code
connection.release();
After the transaction is completed (either committed or rolled back), the connection is released back to the pool. This makes the connection available again for other requests to use.
Handling Errors
javascript
Copy code
await connection.rollback();
connection.release();
If an error occurs during any part of the transaction, the rollback method is called to undo any changes that were made during the transaction. After rolling back, the connection is released back to the pool. This error handling ensures that partial changes are not left in the database, which could lead to data inconsistency.
Pool Management
The connection pool handles opening and maintaining a set number of connections to the database. It handles the creation of new connections if needed, up to a maximum limit (which can be configured). When the application ends or the pool is closed, it will also handle the clean-up of the connections.
By using a connection pool, your application can efficiently manage database connections, which is especially beneficial under high load. Connections are reused rather than being created and destroyed with each use, which can be a time-consuming operation. This results in faster response times for database operations and better scalability for the application.

if I don't declare  a new connection in another controller and I just make queries what happens?

If you do not explicitly obtain a new connection from the pool for each controller or request and instead make queries directly through the pool, the pool will automatically manage connections for you. When you execute a query directly using the pool, like so:

javascript
Copy code
await pool.query('SELECT * FROM myTable');
Here's what happens behind the scenes:

Automatic Connection Management: The pool.query method will internally get a connection from the pool, use it to perform the query, and then automatically release it back to the pool once the query is complete. This means the connection is only used for the duration of that query.

Concurrency: Because the pool manages multiple connections, it can handle concurrent requests by distributing queries across different connections. This allows multiple queries to be processed in parallel, up to the limit of connections in your pool.

Efficiency: This approach is efficient for handling simple, quick queries because it reduces the overhead of manually managing transactions and connections. It's particularly useful for read operations or non-transactional write operations.

Transaction Handling: If you need to perform a series of queries that must be executed as an atomic unit (i.e., all succeed or all fail), you would need to manually get a connection from the pool, start a transaction, and then commit or roll back that transaction as shown in the previous examples. Performing such transactional operations directly through the pool without managing connections would not be possible since each query could potentially be executed on a different connection, thus breaking the atomicity of the transaction.

Error Handling: When using the pool to directly make queries, you still need to handle errors for each query. However, since you are not managing the connections directly, you do not need to worry about releasing the connection back to the pool in case of errors; this is handled automatically.

Scalability: Using the pool directly is generally scalable for stateless, non-transactional queries. However, if your application requires transactions or complex operations involving multiple queries, you would need to manage connections and transactions explicitly to ensure consistency and correct error handling.

In summary, for many use cases, especially those that do not require transactions, querying directly through the pool is a simple and efficient way to interact with your database. For more complex scenarios involving transactions, you'll need to manage the connections yourself to ensure proper transactional integrity.




User
now help me create the following endpoint
/ratings/:userID 
Retrieves a list of ratings submitted by a specific user.  

ChatGPT
To create an endpoint that retrieves a list of ratings submitted by a specific user, you will need to set up a GET route that captures the userID from the URL parameter and then queries the database for all ratings associated with that user. Below is a step-by-step implementation:

Step 1: Define the Route Handler
In your controller file (e.g., controllers/ratingController.js):

javascript
Copy code
async function getUserRatings(req, res) {
    const { userID } = req.params;

    try {
        const ratingsQuery = `
            SELECT title_id, user_rating
            FROM user_title_ratings
            WHERE user_id = ?;
        `;

        const [userRatings] = await pool.query(ratingsQuery, [userID]);

        if (userRatings.length === 0) {
            return res.status(404).json({ message: 'No ratings found for the user' });
        }

        res.json({ userID, ratings: userRatings });
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(error);
        res.status(500).json({ message: 'Server error', error: error.message });
    }
}

module.exports = {
    getUserRatings,
    // ... other exported functions
};
Step 2: Define the Endpoint in Your Routes
Create or update the routes file (e.g., routes/ratingRoutes.js):

javascript
Copy code
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();
const ratingController = require('../controllers/ratingController');

router.get('/ratings/:userID', ratingController.getUserRatings);

module.exports = router;
Step 3: Use the Router in Your Application
In your app.js or equivalent server file:

javascript
Copy code
const ratingRoutes = require('./routes/ratingRoutes');
// other imports and middleware...

app.use('/api', ratingRoutes);

// continue with the rest of your app setup...
Now, you can test the endpoint by making a GET request to /api/ratings/{userID}.

Notes:
This implementation assumes that the user_title_ratings table contains columns for user_id, title_id, and user_rating.
The function getUserRatings uses the pool from utils/database.js to query the database.
The response includes the userID and an array of ratings, each containing the title_id and user_rating.
Error handling is included to respond with a 404 status code if no ratings are found for the user, and with a 500 status code in case of a server error.
Ensure that the userID in the route matches the data type and column name used in your database schema.
Remember to add any necessary authentication and authorization checks to this endpoint to ensure that only authorized users can access their ratings or the ratings of others, as your application's rules dictate.



User
if no ratings return empty response 200 Ok not 404

ChatGPT
Certainly, if the requirement is to return an empty response with a status code of 200 OK when no ratings are found for the user, you can simply adjust the response logic in the controller. Here's the updated route handler:

javascript
Copy code
async function getUserRatings(req, res) {
    const { userID } = req.params;

    try {
        const ratingsQuery = `
            SELECT title_id, user_rating
            FROM user_title_ratings
            WHERE user_id = ?;
        `;

        const [userRatings] = await pool.query(ratingsQuery, [userID]);

        // Instead of returning a 404, return an empty array with a 200 OK status
        res.json({ userID, ratings: userRatings });
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(error);
        res.status(500).json({ message: 'Server error', error: error.message });
    }
}

module.exports = {
    getUserRatings,
    // ... other exported functions
};
In this updated handler:

When userRatings.length === 0 (i.e., no ratings found), we return an empty ratings array instead of returning a 404 status code.
The endpoint will always return a status code of 200 OK, with the ratings array either containing the user's ratings or being empty if there are none.
This approach follows RESTful API best practices by indicating that the request was successfully processed and the user exists, but they just haven't submitted any ratings. It provides a consistent structure for the response, making it easier for clients of your API to handle the data.

now help me create this endpoint 
ChatGPT
To create an endpoint that allows for the deletion of a specific rating by a user or an administrator, you can set up a DELETE route that captures both user_id and title_id from the URL parameters. Here's how you can implement the /ratings/:userID/:titleID endpoint:

Step 1: Define the Route Handler
In your controller file (e.g., controllers/ratingController.js):

javascript
Copy code
async function deleteRating(req, res) {
    const { userID, titleID } = req.params;

    try {
        // Optional: Check if the requester is the user who made the rating or an admin
        // This would involve authentication and authorization logic

        // Query to delete the specific rating
        const deleteQuery = `
            DELETE FROM user_title_ratings
            WHERE user_id = ? AND title_id = ?;
        `;

        const result = await pool.query(deleteQuery, [userID, titleID]);

        // Check if any rows were affected
        if (result.affectedRows === 0) {
            return res.status(404).json({ message: 'Rating not found or already deleted' });
        }

        res.status(200).json({ message: 'Rating deleted successfully' });
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(error);
        res.status(500).json({ message: 'Server error', error: error.message });
    }
}

module.exports = {
    deleteRating,
    // ... other exported functions
};
Step 2: Define the Endpoint in Your Routes
Create or update the routes file (e.g., routes/ratingRoutes.js):

javascript
Copy code
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();
const ratingController = require('../controllers/ratingController');

// Define the DELETE route
router.delete('/ratings/:userID/:titleID', ratingController.deleteRating);

module.exports = router;
Step 3: Use the Router in Your Application
In your app.js or equivalent server file:

javascript
Copy code
const ratingRoutes = require('./routes/ratingRoutes');
// other imports and middleware...

app.use('/api', ratingRoutes);

// continue with the rest of your app setup...
Now, you can test the endpoint by making a DELETE request to /api/ratings/{userID}/{titleID}.

Notes:
The deleteRating function attempts to delete a rating using the provided userID and titleID.
If the rating does not exist or has already been deleted, it responds with a 404 status code.
The response includes a message indicating the success of the operation.
Make sure to implement the necessary checks to ensure that only authorized users (either the user who made the rating or an administrator) can delete the rating. This will typically involve verifying the user's session or token and checking their roles or permissions.
Error handling is included to respond with a 500 status code in case of a server error.



User
I want to ensure that the user can delete only review he has made

ChatGPT
To ensure that a user can only delete a review they have made, you would typically implement authorization checks in your endpoint. This requires that the user is authenticated and their identity is confirmed against the user ID that is associated with the rating.

Here's how you can implement the authorization check within the deleteRating function:

javascript
Copy code
async function deleteRating(req, res) {
    const { userID, titleID } = req.params;
    const requesterID = req.user.id; // Assume req.user.id contains the authenticated user's ID

    try {
        // Check if the requester is the same as the userID in the parameters
        if (parseInt(requesterID, 10) !== parseInt(userID, 10)) {
            return res.status(403).json({ message: 'You can only delete your own ratings' });
        }

        // Query to delete the specific rating
        const deleteQuery = `
            DELETE FROM user_title_ratings
            WHERE user_id = ? AND title_id = ?;
        `;

        const [result] = await pool.query(deleteQuery, [userID, titleID]);

        // Check if any rows were affected
        if (result.affectedRows === 0) {
            return res.status(404).json({ message: 'Rating not found' });
        }

        res.status(200).json({ message: 'Rating deleted successfully' });
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(error);
        res.status(500).json({ message: 'Server error', error: error.message });
    }
}

module.exports = {
    deleteRating,
    // ... other exported functions
};
In this implementation:

req.user.id is used to represent the authenticated user's ID, which you would typically set during the authentication process (e.g., after validating a token).
We compare the authenticated user's ID (requesterID) with the user ID provided in the route parameters (userID). If they do not match, a 403 Forbidden response is returned.
The actual deletion query is only executed if the user IDs match, ensuring that users can only delete their own ratings.
Make sure your authentication middleware is correctly populating req.user with the authenticated user's details before this controller function is called.

This implementation assumes that you have some authentication middleware in place that sets req.user based on the user's session or token. If your authentication system is different, you will need to adjust the code accordingly to retrieve the authenticated user's ID.




User
this is the current tokenValidator function
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');

const validateToken = (req, res, next) => {
    const token = req.headers['x-observatory-auth'];

    if (!token) {
        return res.status(401).json({ message: 'No token provided' });
    }

    jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET, (err, decoded) => {
        if (err) {
            return res.status(401).json({ message: 'Invalid token' });
        }

        // Token is valid, attach decoded data to request and proceed
        req.user = decoded;
        next();
    });
};

module.exports = validateToken;

ChatGPT
Given the validateToken middleware function you provided, it checks for the presence of a token in the 'x-observatory-auth' header, verifies it, and then attaches the decoded token data to req.user. This is a common pattern in authentication middleware.

In your route handler for the DELETE /ratings/:userID/:titleID endpoint, you should use this validateToken middleware to ensure that the user is authenticated before attempting to delete a rating. Once authenticated, you can use the req.user information to verify that the userID parameter in the URL matches the ID of the authenticated user.

Here's how to integrate the token validation and user authorization check into the deleteRating function:

javascript
Copy code
const { pool } = require('../utils/database'); // Make sure to import the pool

async function deleteRating(req, res) {
    const { userID, titleID } = req.params;

    // The authenticated user's ID should be in req.user after the token is validated
    const authenticatedUserID = req.user.id; // Adjust this based on the structure of your decoded JWT

    try {
        // Authorization check: ensure the authenticated user is the one who made the rating
        if (parseInt(authenticatedUserID, 10) !== parseInt(userID, 10)) {
            return res.status(403).json({ message: 'Unauthorized to delete this rating' });
        }

        // Proceed to delete the rating now that the user is authenticated and authorized
        const deleteQuery = `
            DELETE FROM user_title_ratings
            WHERE user_id = ? AND title_id = ?;
        `;

        const [result] = await pool.query(deleteQuery, [userID, titleID]);

        if (result.affectedRows === 0) {
            return res.status(404).json({ message: 'Rating not found or already deleted' });
        }

        res.status(200).json({ message: 'Rating deleted successfully' });
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(error);
        res.status(500).json({ message: 'Server error', error: error.message });
    }
}

module.exports = deleteRating;
And don't forget to apply the validateToken middleware to the route that uses this handler:

javascript
Copy code
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();
const ratingController = require('../controllers/ratingController');
const validateToken = require('../middleware/tokenValidator');

// Apply the validateToken middleware to the route
router.delete('/ratings/:userID/:titleID', validateToken, ratingController.deleteRating);

module.exports = router;
In this setup:

When a DELETE request is made to /ratings/:userID/:titleID, validateToken middleware will first verify the JWT.
If the token is valid, it attaches the decoded user data (e.g., userID) to req.user.
The deleteRating handler then uses this information to check if the authenticated user is the one who made the rating.
If the IDs match, it proceeds to delete the rating; otherwise, it returns a 403 Forbidden status code.
This ensures that only the user who submitted a rating, or an administrator with the appropriate permissions, can delete the rating.

        await connection.beginTransaction();

        // Check if the rating already exists
        const existingRatingQuery = `
            SELECT user_rating FROM user_title_ratings 
            WHERE user_id = ? AND title_id = ?;
        `;
        const [existingRating] = await connection.query(existingRatingQuery, [userID, titleID]);

        // Retrieve the current average rating and number of votes
        const currentRatingQuery = `
            SELECT average_rating, num_votes FROM titles WHERE title_id = ?;
        `;
        const [currentRatingData] = await connection.query(currentRatingQuery, [titleID]);
        const currentAverage = currentRatingData[0]?.average_rating || 0;
        const currentNumVotes = currentRatingData[0]?.num_votes || 0;

        // Update or insert the new rating
        if (existingRating.length > 0) {
            // Rating exists, update it
            const updateRatingQuery = `
                UPDATE user_title_ratings
                SET user_rating = ?
                WHERE user_id = ? AND title_id = ?;
            `;
            await connection.query(updateRatingQuery, [userRating, userID, titleID]);
        } else {
            // Rating does not exist, insert new rating
            const insertRatingQuery = `
                INSERT INTO user_title_ratings (user_id, title_id, user_rating)
                VALUES (?, ?, ?);
            `;
            await connection.query(insertRatingQuery, [userID, titleID, userRating]);
        }

        // Calculate the new average rating and number of votes
        const newAverage = ((currentAverage * currentNumVotes) + userRating) / (currentNumVotes + 1);
        const newNumVotes = currentNumVotes + 1;

        // Update the titles table with the new average and new number of votes
        const updateTitleRatingQuery = `
            UPDATE titles
            SET average_rating = ?, num_votes = ?
            WHERE title_id = ?;
        `;
        await connection.query(updateTitleRatingQuery, [newAverage.toFixed(2), newNumVotes, titleID]);

        // Commit the transaction
        await connection.commit();
        connection.release(); // Release the connection back to the pool

        res.status(200).json({ message: 'Rating uploaded successfully' });
    } catch (error) {
        // If an error occurs, roll back the transaction
        await connection.rollback();
        connection.release();
        console.error(error);
        res.status(500).json({ message: 'Server error', error: error.message });
    }
}

ChatGPT
To update the title ratings after deleting a user's rating, you can follow a similar process to what you've done in the uploadRating function. The idea is to calculate the new average after a rating is removed, which involves subtracting the user's rating from the total sum of all ratings and then dividing by the new total number of votes.

Here's how you can implement this in the deleteRating function:

javascript
Copy code
async function deleteRating(req, res) {
    const { userID, titleID } = req.params;

    try {
        const connection = await pool.getConnection();
        await connection.beginTransaction();

        // Retrieve the rating to be deleted
        const userRatingQuery = `
            SELECT user_rating FROM user_title_ratings
            WHERE user_id = ? AND title_id = ?;
        `;
        const [userRatingResult] = await connection.query(userRatingQuery, [userID, titleID]);
        
        if (userRatingResult.length === 0) {
            await connection.release();
            return res.status(404).json({ message: 'Rating not found' });
        }

        const userRating = userRatingResult[0].user_rating;

        // Retrieve the current average rating and number of votes
        const currentRatingQuery = `
            SELECT average_rating, num_votes FROM titles WHERE title_id = ?;
        `;
        const [currentRatingData] = await connection.query(currentRatingQuery, [titleID]);
        let currentAverage = currentRatingData[0].average_rating || 0;
        let currentNumVotes = currentRatingData[0].num_votes || 0;

        // Delete the rating
        const deleteRatingQuery = `
            DELETE FROM user_title_ratings
            WHERE user_id = ? AND title_id = ?;
        `;
        await connection.query(deleteRatingQuery, [userID, titleID]);

        // Calculate the new average rating
        if (currentNumVotes > 1) {
            currentNumVotes -= 1;
            currentAverage = ((currentAverage * (currentNumVotes + 1)) - userRating) / currentNumVotes;
        } else {
            // If this was the only rating, reset the average and vote count
            currentAverage = 0;
            currentNumVotes = 0;
        }

        // Update the titles table with the new average and new number of votes
        const updateTitleRatingQuery = `
            UPDATE titles
            SET average_rating = ?, num_votes = ?
            WHERE title_id = ?;
        `;
        await connection.query(updateTitleRatingQuery, [currentAverage.toFixed(2), currentNumVotes, titleID]);

        // Commit the transaction
        await connection.commit();
        connection.release(); // Release the connection back to the pool

        res.status(200).json({ message: 'Rating deleted successfully' });
    } catch (error) {
        // If an error occurs, roll back the transaction
        await connection.rollback();
        connection.release();
        console.error(error);
        res.status(500).json({ message: 'Server error', error: error.message });
    }
}
Make sure to adjust any field names and logic to match your exact database schema and application requirements. The .toFixed(2) method is used here to format the new average to two decimal places before updating the database, which should match the format of your average_rating column in the titles table.




User
make the authentication check too

ChatGPT
To incorporate the authentication check, ensure that the validateToken middleware is applied to the DELETE route. This middleware will authenticate the user and attach their data to req.user. You can then compare the authenticated user's ID from req.user with the userID parameter from the URL to verify that the user is authorized to delete the rating.

Here's the updated deleteRating function with the authentication check:

javascript
Copy code
async function deleteRating(req, res) {
    const { userID, titleID } = req.params;

    // Assuming your token validation middleware sets `req.user`
    // and that `req.user.id` contains the authenticated user's ID
    const authenticatedUserID = req.user.id;

    // Authorization check: ensure the authenticated user is the one who made the rating
    if (parseInt(authenticatedUserID, 10) !== parseInt(userID, 10)) {
        return res.status(403).json({ message: 'Unauthorized to delete this rating' });
    }

    try {
        const connection = await pool.getConnection();
        await connection.beginTransaction();

        // Retrieve the rating to be deleted
        const userRatingQuery = `
            SELECT user_rating FROM user_title_ratings
            WHERE user_id = ? AND title_id = ?;
        `;
        const [userRatingResult] = await connection.query(userRatingQuery, [userID, titleID]);

        if (userRatingResult.length === 0) {
            connection.release();
            return res.status(404).json({ message: 'Rating not found' });
        }

        const userRating = userRatingResult[0].user_rating;

        // Retrieve the current average rating and number of votes
        const currentRatingQuery = `
            SELECT average_rating, num_votes FROM titles WHERE title_id = ?;
        `;
        const [currentRatingData] = await connection.query(currentRatingQuery, [titleID]);
        let currentAverage = currentRatingData[0]?.average_rating || 0;
        let currentNumVotes = currentRatingData[0]?.num_votes || 0;

        // Delete the rating
        const deleteRatingQuery = `
            DELETE FROM user_title_ratings
            WHERE user_id = ? AND title_id = ?;
        `;
        await connection.query(deleteRatingQuery, [userID, titleID]);

        // Recalculate the average rating and number of votes
        // ...

        // Commit the transaction
        await connection.commit();
        connection.release(); // Release the connection back to the pool

        res.status(200).json({ message: 'Rating deleted successfully' });
    } catch (error) {
        // Roll back the transaction in case of an error
        await connection.rollback();
        connection.release();
        console.error(error);
        res.status(500).json({ message: 'Server error', error: error.message });
    }
}

module.exports = deleteRating;
Make sure to use the validateToken middleware in the route definition:

javascript
Copy code
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();
const ratingController = require('../controllers/ratingController');
const validateToken = require('../middleware/tokenValidator');

// Apply the validateToken middleware to the DELETE route
router.delete('/ratings/:userID/:titleID', validateToken, ratingController.deleteRating);

module.exports = router;
This ensures that only authenticated and authorized users can delete a rating. If an unauthorized user attempts to delete a rating, a 403 Forbidden status code will be returned. If the authenticated user is the one who made the rating, the function proceeds with the deletion and updates the average rating accordingly.
