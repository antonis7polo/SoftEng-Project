The user Interface will communicate through REST API with the other components of ntuaflix, so i need to add a rest api lifeline right after the user interface lifeline to all 3 sequence diagrams (the search movie diagram(that has all 4 search types with title, date, genre and rating), the search cast/crew member diagram and the rating movie diagram). give me all the new messages and their type from and to the new rest api interface that need to be added for those 3 diagrams.

Incorporating a REST API lifeline into your sequence diagrams for NTUAFlix involves adding an additional layer of interaction between the User Interface and the other components. This layer will handle the API calls and responses. Below are the new messages and their types for each of the three sequence diagrams, considering the REST API interactions.

1. Search Movie Diagram (with Title, Date, Genre, and Rating Search Types):
Initial User Interaction with REST API:
User Interface -> REST API: sendSearchRequest(searchCriteria) (normal) [Note: searchCriteria varies: title, date, genre, rating]
REST API -> Database: apiSearchQuery(searchCriteria) (normal)
Database -> REST API: apiReturnResults(results) (response)
REST API -> User Interface: receiveSearchResults(results) (response)
2. Search Cast/Crew Member Diagram:
Initial User Interaction with REST API:
User Interface -> REST API: sendCastCrewSearchRequest(name) (normal)
REST API -> Database: apiQueryCastCrewDatabase(name) (normal)
Database -> REST API: apiReturnCastCrewResults(results) (response)
REST API -> User Interface: receiveCastCrewResults(results) (response)
3. Rating Movie Diagram:
Rating a Movie with REST API:
Registered User -> User Interface: rateMovie(titleId, rating) (normal)
User Interface -> REST API: sendRating(titleId, rating) (normal)
REST API -> Database: apiStoreRating(titleId, rating) (normal)
Database -> REST API: apiConfirmRatingStored() (response)
REST API -> User Interface: receiveRatingConfirmation() (response)
Generating Recommendations with REST API:
User Interface -> REST API: requestRecommendations(titleId) (normal)
REST API -> Database: apiRequestRecommendations(titleId) (normal)
Database -> REST API: apiReturnRecommendations(recommendations) (response)
REST API -> User Interface: receiveRecommendations(recommendations) (response)
In each case, the REST API acts as a mediator between the User Interface and the Database. It sends requests to and receives responses from the Database, then relays the information back to the User Interface. This extra layer reflects a more realistic architecture for modern web applications, where the front-end communicates with the back-end via an API.

i have created the component diagram and i want to make the lifelines beased on the components on this diagrams. tha components that i am going to be using as lifelines are ths iser interface, rest api, cast/crew info, movie info, search rating and database. the user interface communicates with rest api. the rest api then communicates with one of the cast/crew info, movie info, search or rating lifelines and then the selected lifeline communicates with the database. i will provide you with the messages that we made for the search movie sequence diagram and i want you to enhance them based on the information i just gave you above. for this specific diagram between the rest api and the database i want for the first flow of messages to add the search lifleine (instaed o search controller), for the second flow of messages replace the search controller with the movie info lifeline and for the third flow replace the search controller with the cast/crew info lifeline. give me all the message needed for this diagram in the form of the file i provided you with.

Based on the provided messages and your new component diagram structure, here's the enhanced list of messages for the "Search Movie" sequence diagram with the inclusion of REST API, and specific components like Search, Movie Info, and Cast/Crew Info:
